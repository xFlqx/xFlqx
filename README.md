<!-- ABOUT -->
# What do we do?

## We do websites, dashboards, databases, servers and much more! We're currently looking out for clients who are interested in
a fully custom website (front-end & back-end included).

## Why should you hire us?
* Your time should be focused on establishing your company. We'll sort out the website and graphics as long as you provide content.
* We build websites for as cheap as £300-500 and our maintenance fee is only £15/h (after website deployment)
* With 5+ years of coding experience and still going, you can expect us to build you something amazing.
